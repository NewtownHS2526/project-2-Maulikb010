            <li>Lions are the most social of all wild cat species and historically had one of the widest distributions, second only to humans among large terrestrial mammals. Today, however, their populations are fragmented and significantly reduced.</li>
            <li>The lion's current range is largely restricted to sub-Saharan Africa. A tiny, separate population of the critically endangered Asiatic lion exists exclusively in and around the Gir Forest National Park in Gujarat, India.</li>
            <li>Historically, lions roamed across much of Africa, the Middle East, and even into Europe and the Indian subcontinent. Their modern habitat loss is primarily due to human expansion and conflict.</li>

          <ul class="mt-6 space-y-4 text-white-300">
            <p>Lions are highly adaptable but prefer specific environments that provide sufficient prey and cover. Their ideal habitats include Savannas and Grassland, These are the quintessential "lion country." The open grasslands provide ample grazing animals (prey) and the tall grasses offer camouflage for stalking and resting. Open Woodlands and Shrublands, the lions are often found in areas with a mix of grass and scattered trees, which they use for shade during the heat of the day. Lions typically avoid dense tropical rainforests, extremely arid deserts, and mountainous regions at high altitudes [1]. Water is a necessity in their environment, though they can survive for long periods by obtaining moisture from their prey and certain plants when necessary. </p>
